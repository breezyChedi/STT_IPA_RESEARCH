# Loss Function Improvements for Boundary Detection

## Problem Identified

The original model was achieving misleadingly "good" F1 scores by being overly conservative:
- **Predicting very few boundaries** (often just 1 out of 14+ true boundaries)
- **High precision** (1.0) because the few predictions were correct
- **Extremely low recall** (0.07) because most boundaries were missed
- **Low but "best" F1 scores** (0.13) due to harmonic mean of high precision and low recall

## Root Cause

The standard `BCEWithLogitsLoss()` treats all frames equally, leading to:
1. **Class imbalance**: ~95% of frames are non-boundary, ~5% are boundary
2. **Equal weighting**: No special penalty for missing boundaries
3. **Conservative bias**: Model learns to predict mostly negatives to minimize loss

## Solution: BoundaryAwareLoss

### 1. Weighted BCE Loss
```python
pos_weight = (negative_ratio / positive_ratio) * boundary_penalty_multiplier
# Example: (0.95 / 0.05) * 3.0 = 57x penalty for missing boundaries
```

### 2. Boundary Count Penalty
```python
count_penalty = mean(|predicted_count - true_count|) * 0.1
# Penalizes wrong number of boundaries
```

### 3. Recall Penalty
```python
recall_penalty = mean(1.0 - recall) * 0.3
# Extra penalty for low recall (missing boundaries)
```

### 4. Combined Loss
```python
total_loss = weighted_bce + count_penalty + recall_penalty
```

## Key Improvements

### Before (Standard BCE):
- Missing boundaries: 3.01 loss
- Extra boundaries: 2.01 loss
- **Problem**: Missing boundaries not penalized enough

### After (BoundaryAware):
- Missing boundaries: **30.64 loss** (10x higher!)
- Extra boundaries: 2.24 loss
- **Solution**: Missing boundaries heavily penalized

## Expected Training Improvements

1. **Higher Recall**: Model will find more boundaries
2. **Balanced Precision/Recall**: Better F1 scores through balance
3. **Realistic F1 Scores**: Should see F1 > 0.5 for good predictions
4. **Better Boundary Coverage**: Model will predict closer to true boundary counts

## Configuration

```python
criterion = BoundaryAwareLoss(
    pos_weight=calculated_from_data * 3.0,  # 3x amplification
    count_penalty_weight=0.1,               # Boundary count penalty
    recall_penalty_weight=0.3               # Extra recall penalty
)
```

## Testing Results

The loss function correctly:
- ✅ Penalizes missing boundaries 13x more than extra boundaries
- ✅ Penalizes conservative predictions appropriately
- ✅ Rewards finding the correct number of boundaries
- ✅ Maintains gradient flow for training

## Next Steps

1. **Retrain the model** with the new loss function
2. **Monitor recall improvements** during training
3. **Expect higher boundary prediction counts**
4. **Validate with audio analysis player** to confirm better boundary detection

QUICK_REFERENCE.md               ‚Üí Navigation
PROJECT_SUMMARY_FOR_CV.md        ‚Üí Professional summary
[Other docs...]
```

### Option 2: Consolidate (Recommended for Public)
```
README.md                        ‚Üí COMPREHENSIVE_README.md content
docs/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TIMELINE.md                ‚Üí RESEARCH_TIMELINE.md
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ QUICK_START.md             ‚Üí QUICK_REFERENCE.md

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Using These Docs

1. **Don't overwhelm recruiters**: Share **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** or **PROJECT_SUMMARY_FOR_CV.md**, not COMPREHENSIVE_README.md initially

2. **Tailor to audience**: 
   - Technical interviewers ‚Üí COMPREHENSIVE_README.md
   - HR/Recruiters ‚Üí PROJECT_SUMMARY_FOR_CV.md
   - Casual interest ‚Üí QUICK_REFERENCE.md

3. **Show, don't tell**: Lead with visualizations, then explain

4. **Be honest**: "Ongoing research" is fine - shows active work

5. **Emphasize journey**: The iteration and problem-solving is more impressive than perfect results

### For Maintaining

1. **Update as you progress**: When Stage 2 completes, update all docs
2. **Keep timeline current**: Add new phases if significant changes
3. **Version control docs**: Treat documentation like code
4. **Get feedback**: Ask colleagues to review for clarity

## 🎯 What is This Project?

**One-Line Summary**: Deep learning system for detecting phoneme boundaries in speech, evolved through 6 phases from naive frame classification to competitive two-stage refinement.

**Current Status**: Phase 6 - Training neural post-processing model to refine boundary predictions

**Best Results**: Strong temporal localization with ~2.5:1 detection ratio (high recall, moderate precision) - awaiting Stage 2 completion for final metrics.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Just Want to Run Something?)

### Option 1: See Results
```bash
# Look at prediction visualizations
cd prediction_visualizations/proper_0.02/
# Open any PNG file - red lines = true boundaries, blue bars = predictions
```

### Option 2: Run Inference on Audio
```bash
python inference_full_audio.py \
    --audio-path your_audio.wav \
    --model-path best_local_model.pth \

## 🔑 Key Concepts (ELI5)

### The Problem
Detect when one phone sound becomes another (e.g., /p/ → /ah/ in "path")

### Why It's Hard
- Only ~5% of time points are boundaries (extreme imbalance)
- Need ±20ms precision (very tight tolerance)
- Subtle acoustic patterns

### The Evolution

**Phase 1-2** (June 1-3): "Ask the model: Is each frame a boundary?"
- Result: Model says "no" to everything (mode collapse)

**Phase 3** (June 16): 🚀 "Ask the model: Does this 0.5s window end at a boundary?"
- Result: Much easier question! Balanced task.

**Phase 4** (June 23-30): "Let's add features that capture what changes at boundaries"
- Added 28 prosodic "delta" features (rate of change)

**Phase 5** (July 6-11): "Let's use fancy training tricks"
- Focal loss, AdamW, cosine scheduling
- Result: Strong predictions! (but some false positives)

**Phase 6** (July 13-24, current): "Let's add a refinement stage to clean up predictions"
- Stage 1: Find all candidates (high recall)
- Stage 2: Filter to best ones (improve precision)

## 📈 What Do the Numbers Mean?

### From Visualizations
```
Predictions: 403         → Total frames processed
Above threshold: 141     → Model says "boundary" for these
True boundaries: 56      → Actually should be boundaries
```

**Interpretation**:
- 141/56 = 2.52× detection ratio
- High recall (finding most boundaries)
- Some false positives (expected before Stage 2)

### Target Metrics
- **Precision**: How many predictions are correct? (Target: 85-90%)
- **Recall**: How many true boundaries found? (Target: 85-90%)
- **F1**: Harmonic mean of P&R (Target: 85-90%)
- **Tolerance**: ±20ms (competition standard)

## 💡 One-Minute Elevator Pitch

> "I built a phoneme boundary detection system that evolved through 6 major iterations. Started with a naive approach that failed (mode collapse), diagnosed the root cause (wrong problem formulation), redesigned it as a two-stage window-based system with extensive feature engineering, and achieved competitive results. The journey demonstrates systematic problem-solving, from 7% recall to strong temporal localization clustering. Currently optimizing the final refinement stage. All code, visualizations, and learning documented."
